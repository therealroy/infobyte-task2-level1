      <p class="lead">
        Hello, myself Subrata Roy I'm 23 years old. I've been learning a lot and
        I'm really passionate about building things online. I'm comfortable
        working with the foundational languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I'm also trying to get better at using React to create those cool
        interactive websites you see nowadays. For the back-end side of things,
        I'm using Supabase, and I'm learning more about it all the time. I'm
        still developing my skills, but I'm getting the hang of version control
        with Git and GitHub. When it comes to design, I'm trying out tools like
        Tailwind CSS, SASS, Material UI, and Next UI to make websites that look
        good and work well on any device. For some extra flair, I'm even
        starting to explore Framer Motion for animations. I know there's a lot
        out there to learn, but I'm always eager to improve. It would be awesome
        to connect with other developers and keep growing in this field!
